# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies email messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using a Naive Bayes algorithm and text vectorization techniques.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
- Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
A labeled dataset of email messages categorized as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), typically sourced from open repositories like UCI or Kaggle.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo and open the notebook:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardik-jainn/EmailSpamClassifier
Run the Jupyter notebook: Email_Spam_Classifier.ipynb

ðŸ“ˆ Output Examples
Model accuracy score

Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Confusion matrix visualization

âœ… Outcome
This project demonstrates basic natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction with CountVectorizer, and supervised machine learning using Naive Bayes â€” ideal for beginners exploring text classification.
